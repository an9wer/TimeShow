Parallel vs serial

-   `Why Is Serial Data Transmission Faster Than Parallel Data Transmission?
    <https://www.howtogeek.com/171947/why-is-serial-data-transmission-faster-than-parallel-data-transmission/>`_

    You cannot increase the signal frequency for a parallel transmission
    without limit, because, by design, all signals from the transmitter need to
    arrive at the receiver at the same time. 

-   `The Difference Between Parallel & Serial Communication <https://www.techwalla.com/articles/the-difference-between-parallel-serial-communication>`_

    The use of fewer wires in serial communication makes its signals clearer,
    thus making it suitable for long distance communication.
