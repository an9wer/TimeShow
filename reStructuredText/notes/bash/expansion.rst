Expansion
=========

Pathname expansion
------------------

**Note**: When in pathname matching context (pathname expansion), the slash
character must always be matched explicitly by a slash in the pattern, but in
other matching contexts (e.g. case statement, variable modification,
HISTIGNORE) it can be matched by a special pattern character.
