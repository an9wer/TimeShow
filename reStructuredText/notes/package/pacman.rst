Q
-

Query the package database. This operation allows you to view **installed**
packages and their files, as well as meta-information about individual packages
(dependencies, conflicts, install date, build date, size).

Q examples
""""""""""

Display owners of files (path):

::

    $ pacman -Qo <file> [...]

Display information (e.g. depends) of packages by query database:

::

    $ pacman -Qi <package> [...]

List all files owned by packages by query database:

::

    $ pacman -Ql <package> [...]

Display information of packages by querying package files:

::

    $ pacman -Qip <pkgfile>  [...]


List all files owned by packages by querying package files:

::

    $ pacman -Qlp <pkgfile> [...]

F
-

Query the files database. This operation allows you to look for packages owning
certain files or display files owned by certain packages. **Only** packages
that are part of your sync databases are searched.

**Note**: The difference between *F* and *Q* options is that the former querys
from files database which cantains both installed and uninstalled packages, but
the later only querys installed pacakges.

F examples
""""""""""

Download fresh package databases from the server, which should always be run
at first:

::

    $ pacman -Fy

Display owners of files (path):

::

    $ pacman -Fo <file> [...]

Display owners of matching strings:

::

    $ pacman -Fs <string> [...]

Display all files owned by packages:

::

    $ pacman -Fl <package> [...]
    
U
-

Upgrade or add package(s) to the system and install the required dependencies
from sync repositories. Either a URL or file path can be specified. This is a
"remove-then-add" process.

U examples
""""""""""

Install from local package file:

::

    # pacman -U <pkg.tar.xz>


Custom local repository
-----------------------

Append a section for the local repository to */etc/pacman.conf*:

::

    # vim /etc/pacman.conf
        [<custom>]
        SigLevel = Optional TrustAll
        Server = file:///home/an9wer/<custompkgs>

Create the repository root and databases:

::

    $ install -d /home/an9wer/<customkgs>
    $ repo-add /home/an9wer/<custompkgs>/custom.db.tar.gz

Add a new package to the database:

::

    $ mv </path/to/pkg.tar.xz> /home/an9wer/<custompkgs>
    $ repo-add /home/an9wer/<custompkgs>/custom.db.tar.gz </path/to/package.tar.xz>

Then install from custom repostiory:

::

    # pacman -Sy <package>
