{{{
    /usr/lib/sa/sadc [options] [interval [count]] [outfile]
}}}

*Note*: If outfile is set to `-`, then sadc uses the standard system activity
daily data file (by default `/var/log/sa/saDD`). In this case, if the file
already exists, sadc will overwrite it if it is from a previous month.

*Note*: When the count parameter is not specified, sadc rites its data
endlessly. When both interval and count are not specified, and optioin -C is
not used, a dummy record, which is used at system startup to mark the time when
the counter restarts from 0, will be written. For example, one of the system
startup script may write the restart mark to the daily data file by the command
entry: `/usr/lib/sa/sadc -`.

== Options ==

-   `-C comment`: When neither the interval nor the count parameters are
    specified, this option tells sadc to write a dummy record containing the
    specified comment string. This comment can then be displayed with option
    `-C` of sar.

-   `-D`: Use saYYYYMMDD instead of saDD as the standard system activity daily
    data file name.

-   `-F`: The creation of outfile will be forced. If the file already exists
    and has a format unknown to sadc then it will be truncated. This may be
    useful for daily data files created by an older version of sadc and whose
    format is no longer compatible with current one.

-   `-L`: sadc will try to get an exclusive lock on the outfile before writing
    to it or truncating it.

-   `-S activities`: Specify which optional activities should be collected by
    sadc. some activities are optional to prevent data files from growing too
    large. The activity can be can be DISK, INT, IPV6, POWRE, SNMP or XDISK.
    The activity ALL is equivalent to DISK, INT, IPV6, POWER and SNMP. The
    activity XALL is equivalent to DISK, INT, IPV6, POWER, SNMP and XDISK.
    *Note* that the activities saved in an existing data file prevail over
    those selected with option `-S`. As a consequence, appending data to an
    existing data file will result in option `-S` be ignored.
