== :

{{{
    : [arguments]
}}}

Do noting beyond expanding arguments and performing redirections. The return
status is zero.

-   Do expand arguments:
----
    $ : ${a:=123}
    $ echo $a
    123
----

-   Do flush file content:
----
    $ :>/path/to/file
    $ cat /path/to/file

----

== [[

----
    [[ expression ]]
----

Return a status of 0 or 1 depending on the evaluation of the conditional
expression. Word splitting and pathname expansion are not performed on the
words between the `[[` and `]]` (*Note*: This will expand in `test` and `[`,
see
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/669452/is-double-square-brackets-preferable-over-single-square-brackets-in-ba[this]);
tilde expansion, parameter and varibale expansion, arithmetic expansion,
command substitution, process substitution, and quote removal are performed.

*Note*: When used with `[[`, the `<` and `>` operators sort lexicographically
using the current locale.

Expression may be combined using the following operators, listed in descreasing
order of precedence:

|===
| ( expr )       | used to override the normal precedence of operators
| ! expr         | True if expression is false
| expr1 && expr2 | True if both expr1 and expr2 are true
| expr1 || expr2 | True if either expr1 and expr2 is true
|===

*Note*: Operator `&&` and `||` can not be used in `test` and `[`.

-   If file `abc` is in the current directory, then `test` and `[` will expand
    it first:
----
    $ [ a = a* ] && echo gotcha    # equals to: [ a = abc ] && echo gotcha
    $ 
----

-   But it doesn't matter when using `[[`:
----
    $ [[ a == a* ]] && echo gotcha
    $ gotcha
----

== test [

----
    test expression
    [ expression ]
----

Return a status of 0 or 1 depending on the evaluation of the conditional
expression. Each operator and operand must be a seperate argument.

Expression may be combined using the following operators, listed in decreasing
order of precedence:

|===
| ! expr         | True if expr is false
| ( expr )       | Used to override the normal precedence of operators
| expr1 -a expr2 | True if both expr1 and expr2 are true
| expr1 -o expr2 | True if either expr1 or expr2 is true
|===

*Note*: Operator `-a` and `-o` can not be used in `[[`.

== shopt

{{{
    shopt [-pqsu] [-o] [optname ...]
}}}

`-s`: Enable (set) each optname.

`-u`: Disable (unset) each optname.

`-q`: Supresses normal output (quiet mode); the return status indicates whether
the optname is set or unset. If multiple optname arguments are given with `-q`,
the return status is zero if all optnames are enabled; non-zero otherwise.

`-o`: Restrict optname to those defined for use with `set -o`.

If either `-s` or `-u` is used with no optname arguments, shopt shows only
those options which are set or unset, respectively. Unless otherwise noted, the
shopt options are disabled by default.

Display all options:

----
    shopt
----

Only display enabled options:

----
    shopt -s
----

Only display disabled options:

----
    shopt -u
----

Display options defined by `set -o`:

----
    shotp -o
----

`dotglob`: If set, bash includes filename beginning with a '.' in the results
of pathname expansion.
